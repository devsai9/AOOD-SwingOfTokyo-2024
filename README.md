# King of Tokyo App (AOOD-SwingOfTokyo-2024)
**An App Interface for the King of Tokyo game!** <br>
As a part of an educational project on Java, our AOOD class worked in groups to code a graphical user interface (GUI) for our [game engines](https://github.com/devsai9/AOOD-KingOfTokyo-2024).

## Features
- A Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- Inputs to change game settings
- Dynamic player file reading system that can read from folders
  - Users can code and upload their own custom players to the `/players/` folder
- AI Players (comes with [PlayerNaive](https://github.com/devsai9/AOOD-KingOfTokyo-2024/blob/main/PlayerNaive.java) and [PlayerAI_GeeterPriffin](https://github.com/devsai9/AOOD-KingOfTokyo-2024/blob/main/PlayerAI_GeeterPriffin.java))
- A live output of the game play
- Game mecahnics of King of Tokyo (e.g. managing the player in Tokyo, turn-based game play, etc.)
- Tests for some of the major code
